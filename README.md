User Authentication: Modified authentication middleware to work within a GraphQL context.
Apollo Provider: Integrated Apollo Client to communicate with the Apollo Server.
Database: Uses MongoDB Atlas for data storage.
Deployment: Hosted on Render for seamless accessibility.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: React, Apollo Client
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Apollo Server, MongoDB Atlas
